# ðŸ’«Deployment

Deploying via 2 hosting services:
- [Gatsby Cloud](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/products/cloud/) ([free tier](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/pricing/))
    - Project URL:  <https://www.gatsbyjs.com/dashboard/organization/805645db-b2b7-41eb-9afb-5981d52c12d2/sites>
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/products-release?authuser=0&hl=en) ([Free Spark Tier](https://firebase.google.com/pricing?authuser=0&hl=en))
    - Project URL: <https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/friends-of-foxley-prod/overview>

## Why 2 hosting providers?  
- So that if there are issues in one hosting platform I can see if it's a universal issue or an issue specific to Gatsby.
- If Gatsby changes their plan or becomes too unstable I can easily switch-over to firebase.
- Firebase is quicker to deploy so can check my work quicker
- Gatsby cloud generates a lighthouse report on deployment, so can see vital stats
- Gatsby Cloud is optimised for Gatsby code deployments
