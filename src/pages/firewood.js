      <p>
        Firewood is normally available throughout the winter. We supply it split
        and ready to burn in good sized bags.
      </p>
      <p>
        We ask for a donation of Â£4.50 per bag plus an additional 50p for local
        delivery.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other than occasional donations from local people this is our only
        source of funds to help buy and maintain essential tools.
