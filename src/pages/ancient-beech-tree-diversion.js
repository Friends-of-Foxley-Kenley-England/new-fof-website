      <h1>Ancient Beech Tree Diversion</h1>
      <h2>
        Reasons for the path diversion and fencing around the Ancient Beech
      </h2>

      <p>
        The Ancient Beech pollard on the lower path in Foxley Wood ["Mother
        Beech", Tree ID No. 48125 in the Ancient Tree Inventory] has been a
        cause for concern to Croydon Council for some years, due to an area of
        basal decay not normally visible to passers-by as it is on the other
        side of the tree from the path. The condition of the tree has lead to a
        decision to divert the path out of the area into which it, or branches
        from it, could fall, and to fence the area in order to minimise any risk
        of harm which the tree may pose to users of Foxley Wood. As the tree is
        23m tall, the exclusion circle must be 23m in radius. Exclusion will
        also enable compacted soils around the tree to recover their structure.
        This way of protecting ancient trees is increasingly used on
        conservation sites elsewhere, to maintain their habitat and visual value
        rather than fell them.
      </p>

        The decay may have been caused by the pruning of a large limb, the
        cavity shows fruiting bodies [brackets] of Ganoderma australe [Southern
        Bracket] and has in the past also had both forms of Kretzschmaria deusta
        [Brittle Cinder Fungus]. That the latter has not been seen fruiting for
        several years may be a hopeful sign that resources available to the
        fungus may have been used up and the decay compartmentalised [reference:
        CODIT]. Both of these fungi degrade the lignin in wood which provides
        structural rigidity. The tree can sense the increase in flexing and can
        respond by growing compensatory wood, of greater strength and density
        than normal wood. This can be seen in the arch of new wood around the
        cavity, which may actually be stronger than the original wood structure
        of the trunk. However, it is not known how far any decay may have
        extended up into the main branches, which could break out from the
        pollard union.

        The tree was reduced in height by pruning several years ago to bring the
        crown below those of surrounding trees and reduce the potentially
        destructive effect of wind loading. Beech, especially over-mature
        specimens, are conventionally thought to respond poorly to pruning, but
        the regrowth of epicormic shoots along the pruned branches has been
        surprisingly good, creating a new lower, inner crown of new foliage
        which is a most hopeful sign of the continuing vigour of the tree and
        bodes well for an extended old age. Beech do not normally live more than
        200-250 years, though pollarding can extend life by up to double the
        normal. The age of the tree was estimated 15 years ago [using the method
        in the Forestry Commission Technical Information Note:- "Estimating the
        Age of Large and Veteran Trees in Britain"] at 260 years, so now is
        estimated as 275 years.

        Rather than remove the risk of harm to users of the wood by felling the
        tree, it’s extraordinary value as an ancient tree; the biodiversity of
        the community of organisms to which it is a host, and an ecology in
        itself; its status as a local icon of the wood, and as a veteran tree
        registered on the national database; grant funding from the Mayor of
        London’s Greener City Fund was applied for and won to create the path
        diversion and install fencing. The existing rolled stone path will also
        be removed and the soil around the tree will be improved and decompacted
        by adding a mixture of composted leaf mould and charcoal fines
        [biochar]. This is intended to improve the condition of the rooting zone
        of the tree with natural materials to assist its defence against the
        decay fungi. The work will be carried out by a contractor, assisted by
        the Friends and by Croydon TCV between the 5th and 16th of October. This
        will entail closure of the path.

        badger holes were found adjacent to, and one directly in the route.
        Monitoring of these holes over several months, including with trail
        cameras, showed that only one is active and this is concealed behind a
        fallen tree. Advice was obtained from the East Surrey Badger Protection
        Society which has inspected the site and assisted in obtaining the
        necessary authorisation and licence from Natural England for work to
        take place adjacent to a sett.

        It is understood and expected that restricting access to such a
        well-loved tree will be distressing to many users, some of whom have
        described it to the Friends as ‘’their’’ tree. So many people have
        engaged closely with the bark, the trunk, climbed it and swung from the
        branch swings, admired and revelled in it’s glory, brought children to
        experience its extraordinary character. But we need to protect the tree,
        and the users, who will at least still be able to see it, even if at
        something of a distance, via vistas we will create through the
        surrounding trees, and from re-sited benches, hopefully for many more
        years to come. The only alternative at present is to fell it, and no-one
        wants that….
