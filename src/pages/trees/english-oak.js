      <h1>English Oak Tree</h1>
      <h2>Other names - Common Oak, Pedunculate Oak, European Oak</h2>
      <p>
        The English Oak is native to most of Western Europe. It is found in
        mixed woodland throughout the UK and is most common in the South and
        East. It’s an important feature of the English landscape, renowned for
        its longevity and noted for its distinctive leaves and groups of acorns.
        It is a long-lived tree with some examples over a thousand years old but
        in woodland, where it can grow to over 40m, it usually has a lifespan of
        about 300 years.
      </p>
      <p>
        The leaves have 5-7 pairs of lobes, forming a typical wavy-edged
        outline; the upper surface is dark green and the underside is paler. It
        is closely related to the Sessile Oak (Quercus petraea). The leaves of
        the English Oak have very short or no stalk and the acorns long ones.
        The Sessile Oak is the opposite - its leaves have stalks but the acorns
        don't. This is where the names pedunculate and sessile come from.
      </p>
      <p>
        The English Oak is very important for wildlife: Numerous insects live on
        the leaves, buds, and in the acorns and it supports the highest
        biodiversity of insect herbivores of any British plant (more than 400
        species). The acorns form a valuable food resource for several small
        mammals, notably squirrels, and some birds, including Jays.
      </p>
      <p>
        The English oak has assumed the status of a national emblem and is woven
        into history and folklore. Druids would worship in oak groves, couples
        would marry under their spreading branches and the Yule Log, decorated
        for Christmas with holly and mistletoe, was traditionally cut from oak.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oaks produce one of the hardest and most durable timbers on the planet
        and the English Oak has always enjoyed a close association with the
        Royal Navy, whose ships were constructed from oak timbers until the
        middle of the 19th century, earning the Navy the nickname ‘the Wooden
        Walls of Old England’. Oak is still used in construction and to make
        barrels for wine and spirits.

      <h2>Oaks in Foxley Wood</h2>
      <p>
        Most of of the oaks in the wood are in the higher parts, which is
        Ancient Woodland and has been here since before 1600. However, there are
        very few trees more than about 200 years old, indicating that the wood
        was managed for timber and underwood even then.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both species and hybrids are present and there are several Sessile Oaks
        in Woodland Way. The oldest are pollards, especially the one in the
        narrow belt of woodland between Higher Drive and the Recreation Ground.
        The Friends of Foxley have planted many of both species of oaks in
        glades in the wood made by re-coppicing hazel or where trees have fallen
        making gaps in the canopy, and where the coppicing of the secondary
        woodland has been done below the lower path. The Friends have also cut
        wood from fallen trees to make boards for the benches. The wood from the
        900 year old Roke Oak in Roke Road (removed for housing development) was
        rescued and brought here to provide continuity of habitat for any
        specialist organisms to which it was host.
