Bill has received an e-mail from the Grazing Officer Sean Grufferty to say that he intends to return the sheep to graze Sherwood Oaks Field later this month (date T.B.A.) so the main tasks for the day will be to strim and clear vegetation from around the fence perimeter and remove any plant growth from the fence itself. Whist working along the top path it may also be possible to finish strimming and clearing the section of path which hasn’t yet been done. Time permitting the vegetation around the stock gate at the Burwood Avenue entrance could also be strimmed and cleared to allow good access for the sheep when they arrive.

Although the Government has relaxed all Covid-19 regulations the Delta variant is still spreading so it’s probably best if you continue to bring your own gloves and tools (shears and loppers) if you have them but as usual a selection of FoF tools will be available for those who need them. Please would you also bring your own wipes and hand gel as well as your own refreshments. Please also continue to wear long trousers/jeans and not shorts to avoid getting bitten by ticks and if you do unfortunately get bitten please let Andrew know as we have tick removers in FoF’s First Aid kit.

Andrew will again be bringing FoF’s tools and supervising the work so please let Andrew know if you’ll be able to make the work day – many thanks.
