Our November Sunday work day will be held on the third Sunday 21st November as the second Sunday clashes with Remembrance Sunday and some of us like to attend the 1.30 p.m. service held at the RAF Kenley Tribute on Kenley Airfield.

We will be meeting at 10.00 a.m. at the entrance in Woodland Way and the main task for the day will be to prepare the planting sites for the tree whips which the LexisNexis volunteers will be helping to plant on their corporate work day scheduled for Wednesday 24th November â€“ please see details below.

Depending on how long the site preparations take we may also be able to complete some other outstanding tasks such as finish clearing vegetation encroaching the Junipers in the Juniper compounds as well as finish re-staking the deer fencing protecting the Junipers in the Juniper Glad
