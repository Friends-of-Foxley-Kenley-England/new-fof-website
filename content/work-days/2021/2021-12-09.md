The good news is that the 40 bags of firewood which were bagged up on 11th November have now all been sold and orders are still being received so more bags need to be bagged up and the plan is to meet next Thursday at 10.00 a.m. at the entrance in Woodland Way when the intention is to bag up a further 50 bags to fulfill current orders and demand over the Christmas/New Year period.
