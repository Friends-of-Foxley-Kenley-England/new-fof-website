The main task for the day will be to continue strimming and clearing vegetation along the bottom path the section from Burwood Avenue having been done on the last work day. The path leading down from Woodland Way to the entrance in Northwood Avenue may also need cutting back as well as the path leading round by the badger sets.

Although the Government has relaxed all Covid-19 regulations the Delta variant is spreading rapidly so it’s probably best if you continue to bring your own gloves and tools (shears and loppers) if you have them but as usual a selection of FoF tools will be available for those who need them. Please would you also bring your own wipes and hand gel as well as your own refreshments.

As there is currently a high infestation of ticks please would you wear long trousers/jeans and not shorts and if you do unfortunately get bitten please let Andrew know as we have tick removers in FoF’s First Aid kit.

I won’t be able to make the work day due to prior commitments so Andrew will be bringing FoF’s tools and supervising the work so please let Andrew know if you’ll be able to make the work day – many thanks.
