The good news is that all 32 bags of  firewood stored at Alisonâ€™s has now been sold and Alison has orders for another 18 bags so we urgently need to bag up some more and a firewood bagging day has now been arranged for this Thursday 11th November when we will be meeting at 10.00 a.m. at the entrance in Woodland Way. Anthony, Mick, Alastair and myself will be there but some additional help would be very much appreciated as we hope to bag up 40 bags.
